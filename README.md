## 🌟 About The Project

FieldMeasure is a mobile application designed for professionals and hobbyists who need quick and easy measurements in the field. Whether you're a lumberjack estimating tree height, a construction worker assessing a building, or just curious about the world around you, FieldMeasure provides two core utilities right on your phone.

The app uses your phone's camera and motion sensors to calculate the height of objects and leverages GPS to estimate the distance between two points.
