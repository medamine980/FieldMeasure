# Privacy Policy for FieldMeasure

**Last updated:** October 29, 2025

Mohamed-Amine Benali ("I", "me", or "my") operates the FieldMeasure mobile application (the "App"). This page informs you of my policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data when you use my App.

I value your privacy. The App is designed to be a utility tool that functions directly on your device. **I do not have servers, and I do not collect, store, or transmit your personal information.** All processing is done locally on your device.

## Information Collection and Use

For a better experience while using my App, it may require you to provide certain permissions to access device functionality. The information that the App accesses is used as described below and is **not** collected by me.

### 1. Camera Access

*   **Why it's needed:** The "Get Height" feature requires access to your device's camera to provide a live view of the environment. This is used as a visual guide for you to aim at the top and bottom of an object.
*   **How it's used:** The camera feed is displayed on your screen only. **The App does not record, photograph, or store any images or videos.** The camera access is purely for real-time display.

### 2. Device Sensor Data (Accelerometer)

*   **Why it's needed:** The core functionality of the "Get Height" feature relies on your device's accelerometer to measure the angle of inclination.
*   **How it's used:** Sensor data is read in real-time to perform the trigonometric calculations needed to estimate height. This data is processed ephemerally (in the moment) and is **never stored on your device or transmitted elsewhere.**

### 3. Application Updates

*   **Why it's needed:** To ensure you have the latest features and bug fixes, the App may check if a new version is available on the Google Play Store.
*   **How it's used:** The App may automatically communicate with Google Play services to compare its current version with the latest one available for download. This is a standard process that does not involve the collection of any personally identifiable information by me.

### 4. Log Data

The App does not implement any third-party analytics or logging services that would collect personally identifiable information. Standard app performance data may be collected by Google Play services if the app crashes, as per Google's own policies.

## Service Providers

I do not employ third-party companies or individuals to facilitate my App, provide the App on my behalf, or assist me in analyzing how my App is used. All functionality is self-contained or relies on standard device/operating system features.

## Security

The App is designed to operate offline (with the exception of version checking). Since it does not collect or store your personal data, the risk of a data breach related to your personal information from this App is minimal.

## Links to Other Sites

The "About" section of the App contains links to my professional profiles (e.g., GitHub, LinkedIn). If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by me. Therefore, I strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites. I have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.

## Children's Privacy

This App does not address anyone under the age of 13. I do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

I may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.

## Contact Me

If you have any questions or suggestions about my Privacy Policy, do not hesitate to contact me.
